#### OVERVIEW

### Problem

<section class="body-text">File transferring can be annoying. Most websites require you to create an account, have a limit on file size, or a limit on how many files you can send. Once you reach these limits they might even require you to pay to continue using their service.</section>

### Goal

<section class="body-text">Create a web application that allows users to easily transfer files to others or to different devices. Make the app require no account creation, have no file size limit, and no limit to the amount of files that can be sent. Make the app very simple and easy to use, and have a unique and memorable design that reflects that.</section>

#### RESEARCH

### Personas

<section class="body-text">Altough this app was something that I was in need of, I wanted to make sure that it was something that others would also find useful. I interviewed three people, and asked them their experience with current file transferring and what they would want in a file transferring app.</section>

##### LUCY G, 20

<section class="body-text">Lucy G is an artist who is constantly working alongside clients or classmates. She often has to send multiple files to multiple people. She currently uses both email and text in order to share files but is tired of the file size limit or the time it takes to send files.</section>


##### BRANDON W, 27

<section class="body-text">Brandon W is a software engineer who is constantly working on multiple projects at once. He often has to transfer files from his desktop to his laptop or to his phone. He currently uses Dropbox in order to do so but is tired of having to pay for his account.</section>


##### DIEGO R, 21

<section class="body-text">Diego R is a graphic designer who is constantly sending files from his university's computer to his personal laptop. He currently uses Google Drive to transfer files, but does not like having to constantly log into Google and he often finds himself having to mass delete files in order to have enough storage.</section>

<section class="body-text">After talking with these three people. I was able to get a good idea of what features should be included in the app. The app should be able to transfer files from one device to another, have no file size or amount limit, and not require an account.</section>
