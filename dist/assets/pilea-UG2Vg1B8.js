<section class="body-text">Pilea is a mobile app that assists the user with taking care of their houseplants with a focus on their collection. The app features a calendar style reminder, a plant collection feature, and specific care tips for individual plants. The app was designed in Adobe XD and features a custom icon set and illustrations drawn in Illustrator.</section>

#### OVERVIEW

### Problem

<section class="body-text">As of recently, collecting houseplants have become a popular hobby for many people. Because of this, many struggle with keeping track of their evergrowing collection. On top of this many people struggle when it comes to individual care when their collection becomes diverse.</section>

### Goal

<section class="body-text">Create an app that allows users to keep track of their plant collection and assist them with taking care of their plants. Create a simple and easy to use app with a streamline process for plant collecting and care.</section>

#### RESEARCH

### Personas

<section class="body-text">The first step is researching to see what should be included in the app, what features are really needed and wanted in a plantcare app. Luckily I have a good amount of people around me that also have an interest in houseplants, some much more than the others.</section>

##### NATHAN W, 19

<section class="body-text">Nathan W is a novice plant owner. He has a small collection of random plants that he occassionally expands. He often forgets to water his plants, or waters his plants too often, leading them to yellow.</section>


##### SOFIA A, 23

<section class="body-text">Sofia A is an experienced plant owner. She knows which plants works in her environment and has a large collection of plants. She already has a routine for watering her plants but needs somewhere to keep track of her collection as she is currently using her notes app.</section>


##### SUELY P, 55

<section class="body-text">Suely P is a novice plant owner. She only has a couple plants, mainly ones she gets as gifts. She is aware of her plants, but often finds it difficult to keep track of what lighting and care each plant needs.</section>

<section class="body-text">After interviewing these three people, I was able to get a good idea of what features should be included in the app. The app should be able to keep track of a collection, provide care information, and provide reminders for watering and fertilizing.</section>
