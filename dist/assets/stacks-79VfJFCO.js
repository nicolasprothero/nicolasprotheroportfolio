<section class="body-text">Stacks is a reading-focused app designed to help users track their current book progress and organize their reads into customizable stacks, similar to playlists. These stacks can be shared with friends, offering a natural and organic way to discover new books based on topics, interests, authors, and friendâ€™s recommendations, without relying on algorithms. This app was designed in Figma, with a text-heavy interface designed to minimize distractions.</section>
